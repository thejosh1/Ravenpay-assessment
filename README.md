The link to check out the chart data is https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/bitcoin/ohlc?vs_currency=usd&days=7
It is a historical data.. it doesn't provide volume data to display on the chart, and i didn't find a suitable api in the time allocated to me.
For the orderbook i had to use binance which is not accessible in Nigeria, so the orderbook will only display with the help of a vpn... As with the chart i couldn't find the appropriate api to use in the allocated time.. Also trading view doesn't support flutter yet neither does it have a dedicated orderbook webview widget to use.,
